Soil identification and classification is one of the challenging tasks in the agriculture area of
every country in the World. To fulfil the requirement of food, this is necessary to identify the
accurate soil according to the crop. Nature and type of the soil is identified either manually or
government soil laboratories established in District headquarters. The process adopted is both
labour- and time-intensive. Computer-based soil categorization methods are necessary since
they reduce the time and consumption of resources that aids farmer in the process of farming.
In two streams, this project discusses various computer-based methods for classifying soil.
First are based on advance techniques using image processing and computer vision that
identify soil using various characteristics such as texture, color, and particle size. These
approaches use standard image processing algorithms and techniques. The second is soil
categorization methods based on machine & deep learning, such as CNN, which produces
cutting-edge findings. By streamlining the entire process, deep learning processes primarily
reduce the reliance on spatial designs and pre-processing methods. There is another module
of the project involved which helps in the selection of accurate tree-crop pairings as it is very
important for agricultural planning. This is done by extracting the output from the trained
model and verifying the type of soil with the data available and recommends the optimal tree crop pairings according to the provided csv data.
